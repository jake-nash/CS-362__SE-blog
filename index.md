#### HW0: Introduction

Hi, I'm Jacob Nash, a junior at CofC. This is my second attempt at getting a degree, so far it's going better than the first try. I'm enjoying learning new things again. I work as a math tutor, so if you need help in any math class feel free to reach out; my email is nashjr@g.cofc.edu, and my phone is (843) 847-1338.





#### HW1: Chapter 1


_1.3:  What are the four important attributes that all professional software should possess? Suggest four other attributes that may sometimes be significant._

Acceptability, Dependability/Security, Efficiency, and Maintainability. I also think that all software should be economically feasibile (can be made within a pre-defined budget), ethically sound, unintrusive (concerning users' private information), and, to some extent, future-proof (this is obviously not guaranteed, but software should continue to receive support/maintainence while it is still in use).

_1.8:  Discuss whether professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors or lawyers._

I think that it would be very difficult to create some license that would certify that a software engineer is qualified to work on software; as the book mentions repeatedly throughout chapter 1, software can take on many different forms, each with their own set of necessities and priorities. The license would either be far too specific, requiring all software engineers to be proficient in engineering all possible types of software, or it would be so broad in scope that licesure would not convey any sense of certification because of the lack of specific skill/knowledge checks. 

_1.9:  For each of the clauses in the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics shown in Figure 1.4, propose an appropriate example that illustrates that clause._

PUBLIC - a software engineer should not create software to exploit users' personal data, as this is in no way to the public's interest.
CLIENT AND EMPLOYER - a software engineer should strive to create software that meets or exceeds their client's/employer's specifications.
PRODUCT - software engineers should take pride in their work and ensure that their software is (at least) acceptable, dependable/secure, efficient, and maintainable.
JUDGMENT - software engineers must use thier good judgement to ensure the integrity of their efforts and of the finished product.
MANAGEMENT - anyone managing software engineers should be sure to promote (and themselves follow) professional and ethical work standards.
PROFESSION - software engineers should consider how their actions reflect on the practice of software engineering, and strive to uphold the professionalism of the job.
COLLEAGUES - all software engineers should treat colleagues as equals.
SELF - a software engineer should be dedicated to improving their skills and knowledge of the craft for as long as they practice it, while holding themselves to the ethical standards put forth in the ACM/IEEE-CS code of ethics.

_1.10: To help counter terrorism, many countries are planning or have developed computer systems that track large numbers of their citizens and their actions. Clearly, this has privacy implications. Discuss the ethics of working on the development of this type of system._

In many ways, creating/maintaining software like this (or in practically any military use) would require the individual to ensure that they follow their own personal ethical values first and foremost. Everyone's personal ethics on military action (even in the "preventative" sense) differ; their is no common answer to the ethicality of such actions. I feel that it would be the responsibility of all parties involved to regularly and often check the ethicality of what they are working on, in order to be sure that no lines have been crossed; any software engineers involved in such a project should know where that line is, for them personally, and respect it.
