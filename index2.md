###HW0: Introduction

Hi, I'm Jacob Nash, a junior at CofC. This is my second attempt at getting a degree, so far it's going better than the first try. I'm enjoying learning new things again. I work as a math tutor, so if you need help in a math class feel free to reach out; my email is nashjr@g.cofc.edu, and my phone is (843) 847-1338.
